    <h4 class="odd">Updating from Version 2.x</h4>

    <p>
        If you are updating from Wfdownloads 2.x then please make sure you read and understand the following information. There were some severe
        changes introduced in version 3. <br/> <br/>
    </p>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Change to absolute pathinfo in the upload path:</span>

    <p>
        You *MUST* make sure to edit the upload directory in module preferences to include the servers absolute path instead of a relative
        path.<br/><br/>

        For example:<br/>
        If your servers absolute path to the root xoops folder is /home/domain/public_html to keep the files in the normal uploads folder you would
        now set the path in preferences to /home/domain/public_html/uploads (no trailing slash)<br/><br/>

        If you want to have the files stored outside of the web root for security then you would change the path to /home/domain/uploads (no trailing
        slash) for example.<br/><br/>

        You see above, the uploads folder is now outside of public_html which prevents anyone from gaining access to those files directly. Only files
        submitted after this upgrade will utilise the new system, existing downloads will still use the URL method and therefore the path will not be
        hidden.
    </p>


    <span style="font-weight: bold;">File based permissions were removed:</span>

    <p>
        Wfdownloads no longer has any per file permissions. From now on there will be only category permissions. This means all files within an
        existing category will be accessible by the groups defined for that category. Please make sure the permissions for all existing categories are
        properly set after updating the module.
        <br/>
        <br/>
    </p>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changes in module preferences due to feature changes:</span>

    <p>
        In Wfdownloads preferences check that the submission and autoapprove settings are correct. Due to the new features (mirror system, review
        system reworked) those have changed a bit. Make sure you set those to fullfill your needs now.
        <br/>
        <br/>
    </p>

    <h4 class="odd">Important information related to Wfdownloads 3.2</h4>

    <p class="even">
        If users upload files with multiple periods (.) in the filename, Protector 3.x will disallow the upload for security reasons, however the
        script does sanitize,
        If you trust your users (and don't allow anonymous uploads), you can turn of the multiple dot protection of protector module by following the
        below instructions. <br/> <br/>

        1. Open wfdownloads/header.php in your editor.<br/>
        2. uncomment line 13: //define('PROTECTOR_SKIP_FILESCHECKER', true);<br/>
        3. save & close.<br/><br/>

        Be cautious when disabling the protector fileschecker, and only use it if absolutely necessary or if you fully trust your users.<br/><br/>
