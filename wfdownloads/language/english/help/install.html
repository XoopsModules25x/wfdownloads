        <br>
        <br>
        Upload the 'wfdownloads' folder to {xoops-rootdirectory}/modules folder.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Change and verify folder permissions</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        CHMOD the following folders to 777:
        <br>
        wfdownloads/assets/images
        <br>
        wfdownloads/assets/images/category
        <br>
        wfdownloads/assets/images/category/thumbs
        <br>
        wfdownloads/assets/images/screenshots
        <br>
        wfdownloads/assets/images/screenshots/thumbs
        <br>
        <br>
        Also make sure that the {xoops-rootdirectory}/uploads folder is set to 777.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Install the module</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Login as administrator and enter Xoops Administration page.
        <br>
        Select System --&gt; modules and install wfdownloads from there.
        <br>
        <br>
        On Linux/Apache servers, in order to avoid any kind  of problem in audio/video preview, create a filed called .htaccess with the following text and upload it to the root of your website.
        <code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;AddType video/ogg .ogv
&nbsp;&nbsp;AddType video/mp4 .mp4
&nbsp;&nbsp;AddType video/webm .webm
        </code>
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Configure the module</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Most important steps now will be to setup the group permissions for the module and its blocks via System --&gt; groups and than within wfdownloads administration Mimetype management to decide which files are allowed to be uploaded by users and administrators.
