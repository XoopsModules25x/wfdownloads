        Wfdownloads 2.0x/3.00rc1 to 3.20</h4>

    <p class="even">If you want to import from MyDownloads please select 'Import'.<br/>If you want to do a fresh install of Wfdownloads please select
        'Install'. <br/><br/>We STRONGLY recommends you take a full backup before INSTALLING or UPDATING any module.<br/><br/></p><h4 class="odd">
        Update from Wfdownloads 2.0x/3.00rc1 to 3.20</h4>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>When you do the import the update script will copy the
        data from the mydownloads, pd-downloads or wmpdownloads tables into the database
        of Wfdownloads. After this is done you will still be able to use each module as
        before. It is possible to have all 3 modules running at the same time.<br><br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Did you read the important notes?</span><br><br>A lot of important
        changes in Wfdownloads were introduced with version 3. Before you start updating
        please make sure that you read and understand the <a href="__important_notes_v3.html" target="content">
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Important notes</span></a>..<br><br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">(Optional)Before you start uploading ...<br></span><br>We made a lot
        of changes to
        Wfdownloads. There are a lot of obselete files now that will no longer be used.
        <br>If you feel comfortable with this &gt;you could delete most of the old files in
        the 'modules/wfdownloads' directory - if not skip to the next step.<br><br>If
        you want to do this:<br><br>you are advised to backup your files first ... just
        in case<br><br>Basicly you can delete every file and folder within the 'modules/wfdownloads'
        folder <span style="font-weight: bold;">except for </span><br><br>- the 'images' subfolder and its
        contents<br>- the
        'uploads' subfolder and its contents if there are more files in it then just
        index.php<br>- any file or folder you might have created yourself that came not
        from the original Wfdownloads installation<br><br>Please note that we are only
        talking about deleting files. DO NOT uninstall Wfdownloads.<br>If you feel
        uncomfortable with this than don´t do it. It will create no problems to skip
        this step - just some unused files will remain on your server. ;)<br><br>Upload
        the module to your website<br><br>Upload the 'wfdownloads' folder to {xoops-rootdirectory}/modules
        folder<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update the module<br></span><br>Login as administrator
        and enter Xoops
        Administration page. Select System --&gt; modules and update wfdownloads<br><br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Change your uploads path from relative to absolute<br></span><br>Enter
        the Wfdownloads
        administration section and click on preferences<br>Locate the field for the
        'Uploads Directory' and change the path to the absolute path of your server<br>
        <br>If you don´t know the path you can find it on the Wfdownloads admin section
        main(index)page 'Server Path to XOOPS Root:' and just add the path to the
        uploads folder.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">One example: <br></span>if your current setting
        would be '/uploads' and your server path would be '/xampp/xampp/htdocs/xoops'
        then the new entry for that field would be '/xampp/htdocs/xoops/uploads'.<br>
        <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check your category permissions<br></span><br>Since we removed 'per file'
        permissions in
        Wfdownloads you should check if your category permissions are properly setup to
        allow access to files only to those who are supposed to have it. (see history
        menu for a better explanation of this change)</p>
