        Instructions for importing from myDownloads, pd-downloads and wmpdownloads to Wfdownloads. <br/> <br/>
        We STRONGLY recommends you take a full backup before INSTALLING or UPDATING any module.<br/> <br/>
    </p>

    <h4 class="odd">Import from Xoops MyDownloads into Wfdownloads</h4>

    <p class="even">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> When you do the import the update script will copy the data from the mydownloads, pd-downloads or wmpdownloads tables into the
        database of Wfdownloads. After this is done you will still be able to use each module as before. It is possible to have all 3 modules running
        at the same time.

    <p><span class="auto-style1"><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Upload the module to your website</span></span><br>
        <br>Upload the 'wfdownloads' folder to {xoops-rootdirectory}/modules folder<br>
        <br><span class="auto-style1" style="font-weight: bold;">Change and verify folder permissions</span><br>
        <br>CHMOD the following folders to 777: <br><br>wfdownloads/assets/images<br>wfdownloads/images/category<br>
        wfdownloads/assets/assets/images/category/thumbs<br>wfdownloads/assets/images/screenshots<br>wfdownloads/assets/images/screenshots/thumbs
        Also make sure that the {xoops-rootdirectory}/uploads folder is set to 777.<br>
        <br><span class="auto-style1" style="font-weight: bold;">Install the module</span><br><br>
        Login as webmaster and enter Xoops Administration page. Select System --&gt; modules
        and install wfdownloads<br><br><span class="auto-style1" style="font-weight: bold;">Start the Import</span><br>
        <br>Go into the Wfdownloads admin area. At the top you will find a link Import data.
        Click on this one and you can choose to import your mydownloads data. Once you did
        so go into the permissions tab to set the permissions for the imported categories.
        Until you changed the category permissions you will not be able to see the imported
        categories/files. <br><br><span class="auto-style1" style="font-weight: bold;">Configure the module</span><br>
        <br>Most important steps now will be to setup the group permissions for the module
        and its blocks via System --&gt; groups and than within wfdownloads administration
        Mimetype management to decide which files are allowed to be uploaded by users and
        administrators.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="auto-style1">Optional: Remove myDownloads</span><br class="auto-style1">
